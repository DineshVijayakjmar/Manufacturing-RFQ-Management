# Manufacturing-RFQ-Management
A leading Manufacturing Industry wants to develop Middleware Services for handling “Request for Quote” Processing in their organization.
The Maufacturing Industry has a small plant that assembles various types of agriculture machineries. In order to do this, the Industry wants to buy several parts from its suppliers that addresses the machine design, material choices and price expectations. (Assume that the Industry has only 1 plant).
To identify a supplier who can support in providing high quality product with a reasonable price at the point of need, the Industry floats “Request for Quote” (RFQ) to all its suppliers.
Detailed RFQs allow suppliers to prepare accurate quotes that minimize the potential for cost overruns, delivery delays and at the same time meets the product requirements.
The Middleware services of the Manufacturing Firm will have to collate the needs of products/services from its manufacturing Plant. The inputs needed for preparing a comprehensive RFQ must be provided by the services.
The services must also identify the potential suppliers who can provide the required products.
There will also be an Admin Portal, called as “Fabricate” that has to be developed part of this scope that consumes these Microservices and helps the Admin Staffs with needed data for RFQ preparation.
